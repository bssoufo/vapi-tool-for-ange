### Solution 1: Enhance `SquadBuilder` with "Create-on-the-Fly" Logic

This approach modifies the core logic that builds the squad creation request. When it fails to find a deployed assistant, instead of erroring out, it triggers the creation of that assistant and then continues.

**High-Level Overview:**
The `SquadBuilder`'s `_build_members` method, which currently resolves assistant names to IDs, will be updated. If an assistant ID is not found in the deployment state file, it will use the `AssistantConfigLoader`, `AssistantBuilder`, and `AssistantService` to create the assistant in VAPI, record its new ID, and then proceed with building the squad.

**Implementation Details:**

1.  **Add a Flag to the CLI Command:** Modify the `create_squad` function in `vapi_manager/cli/simple_cli.py` to accept a new flag, e.g., `--create-missing-assistants`. This makes the new, more powerful behavior explicit and opt-in.

2.  **Refactor Assistant Creation Logic:** The logic for creating an assistant is currently inside the `create_assistant` CLI function. To make it reusable, this logic should be extracted into a new method, for example, `deploy_assistant_from_file(assistant_name, environment)` within a new `AssistantDeploymentManager` class or as part of the `AssistantService`. This method would handle loading, building, creating via API, and updating the deployment state.

3.  **Modify `SquadBuilder._build_members` (in `vapi_manager/core/squad_config.py`):** This is the core of the change.
    *   The method currently calls `_resolve_assistant_id`.
    *   The logic would be:
        ```python
        # Inside the loop for each member in members_config
        assistant_name = member_config.get('assistant_name')
        assistant_id = self._resolve_assistant_id(assistant_name, environment)

        if not assistant_id:
            if create_missing_assistants_flag_is_set:
                console.print(f"Assistant '{assistant_name}' not deployed. Creating now...")
                # Call the refactored method from Step 2
                newly_created_assistant = await assistant_deployment_manager.deploy_assistant_from_file(assistant_name, environment)
                assistant_id = newly_created_assistant.id
            else:
                # The current behavior
                raise ValueError(f"Assistant '{assistant_name}' not deployed to {environment}. Use --create-missing-assistants to create it automatically.")

        # ... proceed to build the SquadMember with the now-valid assistant_id
        ```

**Pros:**
*   **Architecturally Sound:** The logic is placed in the correct layer (`SquadBuilder`). Refactoring the assistant creation logic improves the overall codebase by promoting reusability (DRY principle).
*   **Seamless User Experience:** The user runs one command, and the system intelligently handles all the necessary dependencies.
*   **Safe by Default:** The new behavior is behind a flag, preventing unexpected actions for users accustomed to the old way.

**Cons:**
*   **Increased Complexity in `SquadBuilder`:** The builder now has a dual responsibility: building the squad request and orchestrating the creation of its dependencies. This is a minor architectural trade-off for a significantly better workflow.
